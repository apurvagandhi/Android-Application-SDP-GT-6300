# Project Plan

**Author**: Team 094

## 1 Introduction

The Job Comparer system is designed for Android devices to enable users to input, monitor, and evaluate job offers in comparison with their current employment. The system provides functionality to determine the optimal job opportunity based on user-defined weighting criteria.

## 2 Process Description
### Inception Phase
#### Project Plan Development
The project plan will identify the specific tasks required to complete the project, including a detailed schedule and timeline in line with the assignment's deadlines. Team members and their respective roles will also be defined to ensure efficient task distribution based on individual strengths and weaknesses.

*Entrance Criteria* - The team will assess the skills of each member to assign tasks strategically. The project timeline will align with the assignment writeup's schedule.

*Exit Criteria* - The project plan will be finalized and approved by the team.

#### Use-Case Model and Specifications Creation
The team will identify use-cases that align with system requirements, detailing the activities the system must perform to meet the project scope. This ensures a thorough understanding of the customer's requirements.

*Entrance Criteria* - Inputs include system requirements and the assignment writeup, which provides the project's vision and specific system requirements.

*Exit Criteria* - The deliverables include a use-case model and specifications, which must be approved by both the team and the customer.

#### Risk Assessment
Identifying and mitigating risks early is crucial for project success. A primary risk involves the use of new technology, which may require additional time for team members to become proficient.

*Entrance Criteria* - Initial risks will be identified through team brainstorming sessions at the project's start.

*Exit Criteria* - This activity will continue throughout the project, especially during the Inception, Elaboration, and Construction phases. Mitigation strategies will be discussed for identified risks.

### Elaboration Phase
#### Problem Domain Analysis
This phase involves a deeper understanding of the customer's needs and system requirements. The team will refine requirements and develop an "almost complete" use-case model and specifications.

*Entrance Criteria* - Inputs include system requirements and initial use-case models/specifications from the Inception phase.

*Exit Criteria* - The use-case model and specifications will be finalized for customer approval.

#### Design Document Creation
A comprehensive design document will outline what the system will do and how it will function. This document will include models and diagrams such as the use-case model, component model, and deployment diagram, as well as a prototype of the user interface and a list of non-functional requirements.

*Entrance Criteria* - Inputs include system requirements, use-case models, and customer discussions.

*Exit Criteria* - The design document will be complete once approved by the customer, allowing system construction to begin.

### Construction Phase
#### Development
This phase involves writing the code to automate activities identified in the use-cases. The implementation will include classes from the class diagram, user interface screens, and necessary validations.

*Entrance Criteria* - Required inputs include the design document and associated artifacts.

*Exit Criteria* - The development phase is complete when all use-cases are implemented and tested, ensuring all system requirements are met.

#### Testing
Testing involves creating and executing test cases to verify system functionality. Whitebox testing using JUnit will perform unit tests, while blackbox testing will verify overall system functionality and non-functional requirements.

*Entrance Criteria* - Inputs include use-case specifications and non-functional requirements from the Design Document.

*Exit Criteria* - Completion and documentation of all test cases and their results.

### Transition Phase
#### System Deployment
The application will be deployed to the target environment as specified in the Design Document and deployment diagram.

*Entrance Criteria* - A fully functional and tested system.

*Exit Criteria* - Successful deployment of the system on the customer's Android device.

#### Feature Requests
Post-deployment, additional features may be requested by the customer. These will be tracked and, if funding permits, added to the system.

*Entrance Criteria* - Customer input and ideas.

*Exit Criteria* - Completion of meetings with the customer to discuss new feature ideas.

#### Corrective Maintenance
Post-deployment, any issues or bugs identified will be addressed. Maintenance fixes will be applied as needed.

*Entrance Criteria* - Communication from the customer regarding system issues.

*Exit Criteria* - Maintenance phase will conclude one week after system deployment, provided no issues are reported.

#### Customer Service
Providing excellent customer service is critical. This involves technical support and being available to address customer needs, ensuring system satisfaction.

*Entrance Criteria* - The team must be available to the customer, providing technical support as needed.

*Exit Criteria* - Customer satisfaction with the system and after-care support will signify the completion of this activity. Technical support will be available at an hourly rate and assessed on a case-by-case basis.


## 3 Team

Team members: 
- Gandhi, Apurva
- Zhang, Yangyijia
- Zhang, Shiyu

Our cross-functional team consists of three members with expertise in various development stages. Each member possesses a primary role alongside shared responsibilities.

Roles and Responsibilities:
- Project Managerv(PM): (Responsible for) overseeing project deliverables, ensuring client-ready outputs, scheduling meetings, managing team objectives, and monitoring progress. We will rotate this role on weekly basis as needed. 
- Back-End Developer: (Focuses on) implementing server-side logic triggered by user actions on the front-end. This includes creating classes and methods aligned with the UML Class Diagram specifications.
- Front-End Developer: (Develops) all user interfaces and input elements for optimal application functionality. Collaboration with BEDs is crucial for aligning event types with corresponding buttons.
- Reviewer: (Conducts) code reviews to ensure code maintainability and scalability. This is a shared responsibility assumed by all team members throughout the project lifecycle.
- Validation Engineer: (Primarily responsible for) creating unit tests and conducting comprehensive functional testing using both automated and manual methods.

We are collectively committed to delivering an exceptional user experience that streamlines our client's job search process.
